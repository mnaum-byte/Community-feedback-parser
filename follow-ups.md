the tool works, but it can be improved:

1. the sign-in method to uservoice is painful (you need to either  manually copy the cookie or use the browser extension)
2. the search inputs are varied, but matching can be clearly optimized.
3. to go through all the 120+ pages it takes a few minutes. the streamed updates are really good, but maybe performance can be optimized
4. the layout of the page and overall UI is not ideal. maybe a step-by-step wizard in a 3 columns layout would be much better.
5. as threads are found, users should be able to click to either save/delete from the list.
6. as user comments are found, users should be able to select multiple and/or copy to clipboard and/or export selected quotes easily.


future:
- would there be a way to pre-index the older threads and maybe tag them, so that user searches would mostly rely on the server-side DB available (instead of web crawl)?
- how could reddit be parsed?
- how could facebook be parsed?
- how could discord be parsed?
